        <h2>What is JSON Web Token?</h2>
        <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is a secure way of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The payload contains all the
             necessary information about the user and can be signed to ensure authenticity and integrity. It is compact in size, can be sent 
             through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header, and is self-contained. JWTs are useful for authentication and information
              exchange. They consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature, which are Base64Url encoded to form a JWT. JWTs can be used
               to access protected routes without storing sensitive data in browser storage. It is a stateless authentication mechanism and 
               reduces the need for database queries. CORS is not an issue as it doesn't use cookies. Overall, JWT is a flexible, secure and 
               efficient way of transmitting information.</p>

    <h2>Develop, Debug, Learn</h2>
    <p>The speaker who talked about this subject emphasize the differece between early developers and present developers, he stated how early develop 
        sit to write their code, they work hard to make it easy, and simple for the end-users, meanwhile the speaker also talked about nowadays developer 
        who mostly depend on other people's code or copy other people's code to make theirs to be better,but the real problem comes when we need to Debug
        the code, because we aren't the author of the code debugging becomes difficult. The speaker also states how we can bring our ideas to the working 
        evironment of other developers.
    </p>  
    <p>The speaker also made this statement "We are obsessed with coding and creating automated workflows and optimizations. And yet our final 
        products aren't making it easy for people to use them. Somewhere, we lost empathy for our end-users and other developers.
        Maybe it is time to change that." The speaker wants us to understand that these days we have a strong
        passion for coding and automation, and it is important for us to know that sometimes our final products are not user-friendly and may not be meeting
        our target audience. This is because, we may have lost sight of the importance of considering
        the perspective and needs of end-users and other developers. The speaker also suggests a desire to change this approach and improve the user
        experience of our products. The speaker then proposes some ideas for how to accomplish this goal. Overall, the speakers wants developers to
        to learn and make good use of the debugging tool, he wants us to learn to consider our end-users as well.</p>
