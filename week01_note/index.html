    <hr>
    <h2 class="week1-header">Syllabus</h2>
    <div class="week1-div">
    <p>The <span>WDD 330 Syllabus</span> elightens students of the course outcomes which is for students to be able to develop web applications using HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript exclusively, i.e without the use of any third-party frameworks. It is expected that students understands the lessons
        taught about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS from the previous course (WDD 230). <br> <br> Some softwares and resources are required for students 
        to carry out task, <span>Git and GitHub</span> is required and also a good IDE such as <span>Visual Studio Code</span> is required. The <span>course Structure</span>
        is said to be unusual, students are meant to spend the first 9 weeks in teams working on a project, while from the 10th to 14th week students work with their team on 
        a final project of their choice. There are lots of outcomes from the course all which will develop confidence in students as a Frontend developer.</p>

    <h2 class="week1-header">Working with Groups</h2>
    <div class="week1-div">
        <p>There are many issues that could cause a group to be ineffective, but good communication with fellow team members, would result to a sucessful group. On the reading 
           i discovered some tools that could help organize group tasks and communications. I read about <span>Slack</span> and <span>Microsoft Teams</span>, I am familiar with
           them, and I find <span>Trello</span> to be good, one can track his progress on a task using the board. We would also be using the <span>Git</span> Version Control System i am also familiar with some of the Git commands as well.</p>

    <h2 class="week1-header">Managing the Modern Frontend Workflow</h2>
    <div class="week1-div">
        <p>Before now managing the modern frontend workflow appears  to be difficult, but developers have developed tools to help simplify project management, based on the 
           readings there are some tools we can use to manage the mordern workflow, they fall into three categories:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Package managers: Package manager keeps track of what software is installed in our computer, and allows us to easily install new softwares, upgrade or delete existing softwares. We will be using <span>npm</span> as our package manager</li>
            <li>Bundlers: Bundler is an assemblage tool we will use to combine, transpile, concatenate, and minify two or more packages. We are using <span>Snowpack</span> as our bundler</li>
            <li>Task Managers: These keeps track of what needs to be done and when, we wil also be  using <span>npm</span></li>
           </ul>
