      <h2>3.1 Fetch:</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources.
          It can be used to fetch any type of resource, including images,
          videos, and JSON data, and all that without reloading the page.</p>
        <p><b>The basic syntax of <em>fetch()</em> is:</b></p>
        <pre>
  let promise = fetch(url, [options]) <br>
  url - the URL to access.
  options - optional parameters: 
            method, headers etc.
        </pre>
        <p>Without options, this is a simple GET request, downloading the
          contents of the url. Getting a response is usually a two-stage
          process.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First, the promise, returned by fetch, resolves with an object of
            the built-in
            Response class as soon as the server responds with headers. <br>At
            this stage we
            can check HTTP status, to see whether it is successful or not, check
            headers, but
            don't have the body yet. <br>The promise rejects if the fetch was
            unable to make HTTP-request,
            e.g. network problems, or there's no such site. Abnormal
            HTTP-statuses, such as 404 or 500 do
            not cause an error.</li>
          <li>Second, to get the response body, we need to use an additional
            method call.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b><em>Response</em> provides multiple promise-based methods to
            access the body in various formats:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>response.text() - read the response and return as text,</li>
          <li>response.json() - parse the response as JSON,</li>
          <li>response.formData() - return the response as FormData object</li>
          <li>response.blob() - return the response as Blob (binary data with
            type),</li>
          <li>response.arrayBuffer() - return the response as ArrayBuffer
            (low-level representation of binary data),</li>
          <li>additionally, response.body is a ReadableStream object, it allows
            you to read the body chunk-by-chunk.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also different fetch options which includes: <b>method,
            headers, and body</b></p>
        <p>The below button once clicked we get the response body using the <em>response.json()</em>
          method.</p>
        <button id="fetchBtn">Fetch JSON Data</button>
        <div id="jsonData"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h2>3.5 Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>
          Fetch is a modern JavaScript API for making HTTP requests.
          By default, fetch() does not allow for cross-origin requests.
          This means that a request made from one website to a different
          website (i.e. a different origin) will be blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it is possible to perform cross-origin requests with fetch()
          by using the following two methods:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Setting the "mode" option in the fetch() request to "cors"</li>
            <li>Providing an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header in the
              response from the server</li>
          </ol>
        <p>
          Example usage of fetch() with "mode" option set to "cors":</p>
          <pre id="code">
  fetch('https://example.com', {
    mode: 'cors'
  })
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Network
       response was not ok`);
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(`There was a 
    problem with the 
    fetch operation:`, error);
  });
        </pre>
        <p>
          Note: Cross-origin requests made with fetch() are subject to the
          same-origin policy, unless the server explicitly allows cross-origin
          requests by providing the appropriate headers.
        </p>
        <p><b>What is Preflight Request?</b></p>
        <p>A CORS preflight request is a CORS request that checks to see if the
          CORS protocol is
          understood and a server is aware using specific methods and headers.
          It is an OPTIONS
          request, using three HTTP request headers:
          Access-Control-Request-Method ,
          Access-Control-Request-Headers , and the Origin header.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>Rest parameters allow us to represent an indefinite
          number of arguments as an array.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre id="rest-example"></pre>
        <p>Spread syntax allows us to expand elements of an
          array into individual elements.</p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre id="spread-example"></pre>
        <p>When we see "..." in the code, it is either rest parameters or the
          spread syntax. <br><br>
          There's an easy way to distinguish between them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When ... is at the end of function parameters, it's ‚Äúrest
            parameters‚Äù and gathers the rest of the list of arguments into an
            array.</li>
          <li>When ... occurs in a function call or alike, it's called a ‚Äúspread
            syntax‚Äù and expands an array into a list.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Use patterns:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rest parameters are used to create functions that accept any
            number of arguments.</li>
          <li>The spread syntax is used to pass an array to functions that
            normally require a list of many arguments.</li>

      <h2>Single Page Application (SPA)</h2>
      <div class="section">
        <p>A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that
          interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page
          with new data from the server, instead of loading entire new pages
          from a server. This gives the user a smooth, fast and seamless
          experience.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>In a traditional web application, the browser sends a request to the
          server for a new page each time the user navigates to a different
          page. In a SPA, the browser sends a single initial request to the
          server to load the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, and then all
          subsequent interactions with the server are done using AJAX requests.
          This means that only the data required for the current page is sent to
          the browser, instead of the full HTML code for each new page.</p>
        <p>This allows the SPA to update the current page dynamically, without
          the need for a full page refresh. This leads to a much faster and
          smoother user experience, as the browser does not need to reload the
          entire page every time the user navigates to a new section of the
          application.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of Single Page Applications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Faster and smoother navigation for users</li>
          <li>Improved user experience</li>
          <li>Reduced server load</li>
          <li>Easier to develop and maintain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The dynamic updates are achieved through the use of JavaScript, which
          makes asynchronous requests to the server for new data. This approach
          provides a more seamless user experience compared to traditional
          multi-page web applications, where the entire page must reload to
          display new content.
        </p>
        <button id="toggle">Toggle Details</button>
        <div id="details" style="display: none;">
          <p>
            SPAs can improve the speed and responsiveness of the application by
            reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the
            server to the client. They also provide a more native-like
            experience for the user, since there are no full page reloads.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some popular JavaScript frameworks for building SPAs include React,
            Angular, and Vue.js. These frameworks provide a set of tools and
            abstractions for building SPAs, making it easier to manage the state
            of the application and update the UI in response to user
            interactions.

        <h2>The Problem with Single Page Apps</h2>
        <div class="section">
          <p>Single Page Apps (SPAs) are web applications that load a single
            HTML page and dynamically update its content as the user interacts
            with it.</p>
          <p>However, the problem with SPAs is that they can have poor search
            engine optimization (SEO) and slow initial load times, because all
            the necessary resources, such as JavaScript, CSS, and images, are
            loaded in a single request.</p>
          <p>To demonstrate the issue with SPAs, here's an example of a
            slow-loading SPA, the initial loading is visible:</p>
          <button id="load-spa">Load SPA</button>
          <pre id="spa-example"></pre>
        </div>
      </div>
      <script src="js/note.js"></script>
