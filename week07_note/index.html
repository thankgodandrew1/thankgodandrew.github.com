        <h2 class="header">CSS-Animations</h2>
		<p>Animations are a great way to add visual interest and interactivity to web pages, and they can be created using CSS without any 
            JavaScript code. CSS animations can be further enhanced using JavaScript, however, to create more complex and interactive effects.</p>
		<p>CSS transitions are a simple way to create fluid animations that are triggered when a property value changes. The browser paints
            the animation, so all that's required is to change the property, and the transition is handled automatically. There are four
            main properties used to describe CSS transitions: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and 
            transition-delay. These can be declared together using the shorthand transition property, and can be used to animate multiple
            properties at once.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Variable Scope, Closure</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a function-oriented language which means that a function can be created and passed as an argument to another function,
            and then called from a totally different place of the code later.</p>
        <p>There are 3 ways to declare a variable in JavaScript: let, const, and var. This article uses let variables in examples.</p>
        <h3>Code Blocks</h3>
        <p>If a variable is declared inside a code block, it is only visible inside that block. We can use this to isolate a piece of code 
           that does its task with variables that only belong to it.</p>
        <h3>Nested Functions</h3>
        <p>A function is called "nested" when it is created inside another function. A nested function can be returned either as a property 
            of a new object or as a result by itself. It can then be used somewhere else. No matter where, it still has access to the same
            outer variables.</p>
        <h3>Lexical Environment</h3>
        <p>Every running function, code block, and the script as a whole have an internal (hidden) associated object known as the Lexical 
           Environment. The Lexical Environment object consists of two parts: Environment Record and a reference to the outer lexical 
           environment. A "variable" is just a property of the special internal object, Environment Record. "To get or change a variable" 
           means "to get or change a property of that object".</p>

        <h2>Currying</h2>
    <p>Currying is an advanced technique used in many programming languages, including JavaScript. It is a transformation of functions that 
        translates a function from a callable format, such as f(a, b, c), to a format where it is callable as f(a)(b)(c). Currying does not
         call a function, but rather it transforms it, making it easier to work with and more flexible. The implementation of currying is 
         straightforward, as it involves creating two wrappers that can be used to pass arguments to a function.</p>
    <p>One practical use for currying is with logging functions, such as the function log(date, importance, message), which formats and 
        outputs information. Using currying, this function can be transformed into a partially applied function, allowing for greater 
        convenience and flexibility when logging. Currying also allows for the creation of other convenience functions, such as for current
         logs, which can save time and effort in real-world projects.</p>
    <p>There are many advanced curry implementations that can be used in multi-argument functions. These implementations use if execution
         branches that either pass a call to the original function or create a partial when there are not enough arguments. However, it is
          important to note that currying requires a function to have a fixed number of arguments, and functions that use rest parameters cannot
           be curried in this way.</p>

    <div class="question">I was wondering, what would happen if JavaScript does not have the closure feature? <br> What limitation would be in JS functions?</div>
