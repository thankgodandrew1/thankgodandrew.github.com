    <h2 class="week3-header">Debugging in the Browser</h2>
    <div class="week3-div">
      <p>
        This concept introduces a tool developers can use to debug their
        scripts. Firstly, <em>Debugging</em> is the process of finding and
        fixing errors within a script, this script debugging tool are widely
        supported by modern browsers, thers's a special UI in developer tools
        that makes debugging much easier. This tool is found in the
        <em>Sources</em> panel. In the reading we were introduced to a
        <em>"Breakpoint"</em> A <em>breakpoint</em> is a point of code where the
        debugger will automatically pause the JavaScriot execution, at that
        point we can examine current variables, in general we can debug it.
        <br><br>
        There are also conditional breakpoints, and it is useful when we need to
        stop only for a certain function parameters. We can also pause a code in
        the developers tool using the <em>debuggger</em> command. The debugger
        command only works when the dev tool is open. Other important things to
        know is the environments we will use to examiine our codes, they
        includes:
      </p>
      <ul class="week4-ul">
        <li class="circle"><b>Watch</b>
            - this shows the current values for any expression.</li>
        
        <li class="circle"> <b>Call Stack</b>
            - this shows the nested call chain and</li>
        
        <li class="circle"><b>Scope</b>
            - this shows the current variables.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        There also some other key symbols or hotkey we can use to trace
        executions in our codes, ranging from:
      </p>
      <ul class="week4-ul">
        <li class="circle">"Resume"
            >: continues the execution, hotkey F8.</li>
        
        <li class="circle">"Step into":>
            hotkey F11.</li>
        
        <li class="circle"><em>"Step out":</em>
            >continue the execution till the end of the current function, hotkey
            Shift+F11. There are some other buttons too that helps trace the
            execution of our code.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With this available tools one can debug his/her code using the browser.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="week3-header">Coding Style</h2>
    <div id="week3-div">
      <p>
        To make our code clean and more readable as possible developers need to
        apply the general coding style. there is a general syntax for that. The
        following rules should be applied to help make our code readable, and
        clean.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A space between parameters</li>
        <li>
          No space between the function name and parentheses between the
          parentheses and the parameter
        </li>
        <li>Curly brace { on the same line, after a space</li>
        <li>Indentation 2 spaces</li>
        <li>A space after for/if/whileâ€¦</li>
        <li>An empty line between logical blocks</li>
        <li>Spaces around a nested call</li>
        <li>A space between arguments</li>
        <li>Spaces around operators</li>
        <li>A semicolon ; is mandatory</li>
        <li>Lines are not very long</li>
        <li>} else { without a line break</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The below code image clearly implements the coding style listed above

    <h2 class="week3-header">Error handling, "try...catch"</h2>
    <div class="week3-div">
      <p>
        As developers we sometimes have errors in our script, this causes our
        code to break down, But there's a syntax construct
        <em>try...catch</em> that allows us to <em>"catch"</em> errors so the
        script can, instead of dying, do something more reasonable. in the
        <em>try { ...</em> block the code is run in that section, the
        <em>catch (err) {...</em> helps in the case of errors and
        <em>finally { ...</em> is used in any case after
        <em>try or catch</em> sometimes there may be no <em>catch</em> section
        or no <em>finally</em>, so shorter constructs <em>try...catch</em> and
        <em>try...finally</em> are also valid. The Error objects have the
        following properties:
      </p>
     <ul>
        <li class="circle">
            <em>message</em> - the human-readable error message.
          </li>
          <li class="circle">
            <em>name</em> - the string with error name (error constructor name).
          </li>
          <li class="circle">
            <em>stack</em> (non-standard, but well-supported) - the stack at the
            moment of error creation.
          </li>
     </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes an error object is not needed, we omit it by using
        <b><em>catch {</em></b> instead of <b><em>catch (err) {</em></b
        >. <br>
        We can also generate our own errors using the throw operator. <br>
        There is a global error handler that catches errrors that fall out. In
        browser it is called <em>window.oneerror</em>. It's one of the easiest
        ways to log client-side errors and report them to your servers.
