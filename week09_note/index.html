	<h2>LocalStorage, sessionStorage</h2>
    <p>This text is about two web storage objects - <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> - that allow saving key/value
         pairs in the browser. The data stored in these objects can survive page refresh (for <code>sessionStorage</code>) and even full browser
          restarts (for <code>localStorage</code>). The storage capacity of web storage objects is larger than cookies, and modern browsers
           allow at least 5 MB of data storage.</p>
    <p><code>localStorage</code> is shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin, while <code>sessionStorage</code> exists only
         within the current browser tab. Both objects provide methods and properties such as <code>setItem(key, value)</code>, <code>
            getItem(key)</code>, <code>removeItem(key)</code>, <code>clear()</code>, <code>key(index)</code>, and <code>length</code>.
             We can use a plain object way of getting/setting keys, but it is not recommended.</p>
    <p>To loop over keys, we can use a for loop or <code>Object.keys(localStorage)</code> method. Both key and value must be strings, but we
         can use JSON to store objects. The <code>sessionStorage</code> object is much more limited compared to <code>localStorage</code> as 
         it only exists within the current browser tab and doesn't survive closing and reopening the tab.</p>

    <p>The code below is an example of using the <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> objects in JavaScript. The code 
        sets a key-value pair in <code>localStorage</code> with the key "name" and the value "John", retrieves the value using <code>
            getItem()</code>, logs the value to the console, and then removes the key-value pair using <code>removeItem()</code>. Next,
            it sets a key-value  pair in <code>sessionStorage</code> with the key "age" and the value "30",
            retrieves the value using <code>getItem()</code>, logs the value to the console, and then clears the <code>sessionStorage</code> 
            using <code>clear()</code>. This is a simple demonstration of how I learned to use these two web storage objects in JavaScript
            to store and retrieve data.
    <pre>
        // Example of using localStorage
        localStorage.setItem("name", "John");
        console.log(localStorage.getItem("name")); // Output: "John"
        localStorage.removeItem("name");
        
        // Example of using sessionStorage
        sessionStorage.setItem("age", "30");
        console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("age")); // Output: "30"
        sessionStorage.clear();
    </pre>

    <h2>Drawing graphics</h2>
    <h3>Canvas and WebGL</h3>
	<p>In summary this article on drawing graphics by MDN introduces the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and associated Canvas API, which provide 
    tools for creating 2D animations, games, data visualizations, and other types of applications, especially when 
    combined with some of the other APIs the web platform provides. The article also provides resources to help one
    learn more about drawing graphics on <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements using JavaScript. Additionally, the 
    article touches on the basics of using WebGL to create real 3D graphics inside our web browser. Finally, the
    article provides an active learning exercise that shows how to create and size our own canvas using JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>2D Canvas Basics</h3>
    <p>This lesson/article on drawing graphics also covers the basics of working with the 2D canvas in HTML5. It covers how to manipulate the
        CanvasRenderingContext2D object, and provides examples of how to draw shapes, including simple rectangles, strokes and line widths,
        and paths. The lesson also introduces common canvas methods, such as <code>beginPath()</code>, <code>moveTo()</code>, <code>fill()</code>,
        and <code>stroke()</code>.</p>

    <h3>Loops and Animations in 2D Canvas</h3>
    <p>This lesson also teaches loops and animations in 2D canvas. Loops can be used to animate a canvas and can run canvas commands inside a 
       for loop. The example provided shows how to create a loop that continuously draws a series of triangles that get smaller and rotate each
       time. Animations in canvas are achieved by running functions repeatedly using <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code>. 
       This function runs a function for each frame, and if that function draws the new update to the animation, the animation loop will
    continue to run.</p>

    <h3>WebGL Basics</h3>
    <p>This lesson also covers WebGL basics, which is a 3D canvas content API based on OpenGL that allows developers to communicate directly 
       with the computer's GPU. Writing raw WebGL is complex, but there are third-party JavaScript libraries such as Three.js, PlayCanvas, 
       or Babylon.js that handle the WebGL for you, letting you work on a higher level. The lesson demonstrates how to recreate a 3D spinning
       cube with Three.js by creating a new scene, camera, and renderer, then loading and mapping a texture onto a cube object, and finally 
       rendering it onto a canvas.</p>
